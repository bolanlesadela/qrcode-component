## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/) - For fonts


### What I learned
 Below are some key aspects I've learned throughout the development process:

Utilizing Google Fonts for custom font integration.
Implementing responsive design using media queries for various screen sizes.
Positioning elements using CSS properties like transform and position.


```css
@media (max-width:768px){
 
    .container{
        width: 40vw;
       transform: translate(75%,31%);
    }
    
 }
 ```


### Continued development

While I've implemented basic responsiveness in this project, I want to refine my skills in optimizing layouts for a wider range of devices and screen sizes, including large desktop screens and various mobile devices.

I also aim to improve my proficiency in using Git for version control and collaborating with other developers on projects.
